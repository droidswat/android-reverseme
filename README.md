Android apps that tests basic and advanced fundamentals of Android app reverse engineering

Apps are broken into three levels:
1. Beginner - Nothing too fancy here. Basic understanding of common data manipulation, encryption, and android app functionality.
2. Intermediate - Beginner, but with much more advanced techniques for each. Hardly any 'giveaway' flags will be present in this app.
3. Advanced - This will take all the fundamentals learned in the previous apps and apply new techniques to deter the reverse engineer.
